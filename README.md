# jeep-racing
This is the source of my first attempt of a large-scale game, Jeep Racing, which I began working on in February 2018 and has since been cancelled.

Despite attempting to split segments of my code into modules at the last minute, this code became quite difficult to maintain, which likely contributed to my increasing lack of motivation to continue working on the project.

### What I learned from this project
- Modularisation and consistency is important
  - It becomes very difficult to maintain a project once it reaches a certain size. Putting too much into single scripts makes it difficult to find what you're looking for and debug your code properly when issues arise.
- Over-hyping a project is probably a bad idea
  - It's more important to get a game closer to a finished state than request help from lots of people, such as artwork and translations, which aren't necessary until the game is closer to completion.
